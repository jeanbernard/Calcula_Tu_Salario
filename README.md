#Calcula Tu Salario

![](https://travis-ci.org/jeanbernard/Calcula_Tu_Salario.svg?branch=master)

Look man, math is hard ðŸ¤”. You know what's just as hard as math? Dominican labor laws ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡´. Both are used to calculate how much you earn for a living. Bummer, I know ðŸ˜ž.

Rejoice! This iOS app deals with the math *AND* laws for you. Hooray! ðŸŽ‰ Now you can focus on buying tacos ðŸ˜€.

#Getting Started

Thank you stopping by and taking an interest in the repo :]

This project is a work in progress so i'll post here what you should consider if you wanna check it out:

* Clone the repo and open the .xcodeproj file in Xcode 7.
* Checkout from Xcode 7 also works.
* Unit tests can be run manually from inside Xcode. It'll even show you the current code coverage (currently stands at 78%! ðŸ˜Ž)
* I decided to use MVVM as opposed to the traditional MVC ðŸ¤“. For more info on MVVM: http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/09/24/mvvm-in-swift/
* I follow this style guide for organizing my Swift code https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide
* TDD is the almighty God ðŸ˜‡. If you want to contribute, you must appease the TDD God with unit tests.

#Features

- [x] Calculates monthly net salary taking into account all the deductions that come from government taxes (AFP, SFS, ISR).

*coming soon*

#Warning!

This is a pet project of mine for learning iOS development with Swift so things might not be...well....perfectðŸ˜….
If you made it this far and still haven't quite figured it out yet, this app is intended for use in the Dominican Republic ONLY. You can, however, come to the DR and experience the caribbean sun! We have cerveza ðŸ˜¬.
